This is an experimentation of how to add text on the top of an ArcLayer
- modify TextLayer and MultiIconLayer to set position on the top of the arc
- create a compositeLayer (Arclayer + Custom TextLayer)

### Usage

Copy the content of this folder to your project.

To see the base map, you need a [Mapbox access token](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/).

You need to set `MAPBOX_TOKEN` directly in `app.js`.

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn
# bundle and serve the app with webpack
npm start
```
